# memory-cards

"Memory/Match Cards" card game.
Rules of the game:
- 24 cards are placed face-down.
- The player turns over two cards.
- If the cards match, they are kept open.
- If the cards do not match, they are turned face-down.
- Play continues until all the cards have been opened up.
Requirements:
- App should use React
- App should use Redux
- Add at least one meaningful unit test
- No excessive styling is needed, but the app should be responsive and use flexbox.
- App should track how long it takes a player to finish the game.
- App should track how many card clicks it takes a player to finish the game.
- Top 10 results should be displayed.
- Browser should remember top results.
- Images should be loaded using a public REST or GraphQL based API. You can select any api, but here are couple options, if you looking for inspiration:
- Deck of cards API: https://deckofcardsapi.com/
- Rick and Morty API https://rickandmortyapi.com/
- Pokemon API: https://pokeapi.co/
- Dogs API: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
- Magic The Gathering API: https://docs.magicthegathering.io/
- Do not hardcode images names or ids in the app. Randomise and load a new set of images for each game.
Notes:
- If your selected API uses auth keys, they should be provided together with the code.
- Be aware that some public API's have rate limits.
