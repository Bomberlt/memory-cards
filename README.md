# memory-cards

"Memory/Match Cards" card game.
Rules of the game:
- 24 cards are placed face-down.
- The player turns over two cards.
- If the cards match, they are kept open.
- If the cards do not match, they are turned face-down.
- Play continues until all the cards have been opened up.
Requirements:
- App should use React
- App should use Redux
- Add at least one meaningful unit test
- No excessive styling is needed, but the app should be responsive and use flexbox.
- App should track how long it takes a player to finish the game.
- App should track how many card clicks it takes a player to finish the game.
- Top 10 results should be displayed.
- Browser should remember top results.
- Images should be loaded using a public REST or GraphQL based API. You can select any api, but here are couple options, if you looking for inspiration:
- Deck of cards API: https://deckofcardsapi.com/
- Do not hardcode images names or ids in the app. Randomise and load a new set of images for each game.
Notes:
- If your selected API uses auth keys, they should be provided together with the code.
- Be aware that some public API's have rate limits.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
